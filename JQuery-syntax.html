    <h1>JQuery Syntax</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>$(this).hide(): hides the current element</li>
        <li>$("p").hide(): hides all &lt;p&gt; elements</li>
        <li>$(".test").hide(): hides all elements with class = "test"</li>
    <li>$("#test").hide(): hides the element with id="test"</li></ul>
    <li>JQuery uses CSS syntax to select elements</li>
    <li>All JQuery methods in out examples are inside a document ready event</li>
    <li>This is to prevent any JQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready)</li>
    <li>It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it.  This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section</li>
    <li>Here are some expamples of actions that can fail if methods are run before the document is fully loaded
        <ul>
            <li>Tryin to hide an element that is not created yet</li>
            <li>Trying to get the size of an image that is not loaded yet</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The JQuery tream has created a shorter method for the document ready event [ $(function(){ //jquery methods go here});]</li>
